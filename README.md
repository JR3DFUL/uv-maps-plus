# UV Maps+

UV Maps+ is a Blender Extension that removes the 8 UV map limit, allows for UV reordering, and adds batch editing tools for managing UV maps across multiple objects.

---
## Features

* **Reorder UV maps** with `▲`/`▼` arrows or move directly to top/bottom
* **Specials menu** with sort, reverse, duplicate, and delete options
* **Batch operations** for multiple selected objects: sync order, copy unique map names, and transfer UV data (matching topology required)
* **Edit Mode tools** for copying and pasting UV coordinates between selections
* **Warning system** highlights UV maps in slots 9+ that cannot be edited in Blender's UV Editor—reorder to slots 1–8 to edit
